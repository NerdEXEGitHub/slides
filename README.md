# Slides

## What?

It's just a bad clone of PowerPoint

## How do I make presentations

1. Go to the presentations folder
2. Make a folder with the name of your presentation
3. For however many slides you want, make a file with the name of the # of the slide minus 1, followed with ".html", e.g. if I want to create a presentation with 10 slides, my files will be: 0.html, 1.html, 3.html, etc. until I reach 9.html
4. Input HTML in the files to edit the slides

## How do I view the presentations

1. Open Bash / CMD / PowerShell etc.
2. Do `node .` / `sudo node .`
3. Open [http://localhost:39771/](http://localhost:39771/)
4. Click on the presentation
5. Press `->` or `<-` to view the presentation

## Are you gonna make a slides editor

Maybe later
